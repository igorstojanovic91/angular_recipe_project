# CourseProject

## About the project
This project was created in order to deepen my knowledge in Angular as part of the amazing course ["Angular - The complete Guide (2021 Edition)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) from Maximilian Schwarzmüller.
The course included various topics, such as:

* Components, Services, Driectives
* Dependency Injection
* Client-Side Routing
* Observables
* Forms
* Pipes
* HTTP Requests
* Authentication with Firebase
* Modules & Lazy Loading
* and so on...



## Technical Info

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
